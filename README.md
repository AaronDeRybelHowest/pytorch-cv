# PyTorch for Computer Vision<br/>Example 1 - Convolutional Bebezal Network

**After this notebook, you'll be able to:**
- Use a folder with labels as subfolders as a dataset
- Split train dataset into train, test and val datasets
- Apply transformations in images for data augmentation
- Create a Convolutional Neural Network
- Train and validate your Convolutional Neural Network
- Analyze metrics obtained in training task
- Run inference in test dataset

**TO DO**
- Detect faces in a image, using another CNN
- Train and validate, using only face detected

The architecture of the neural network created in this notebook is based on paper "Facial Expression Recognition Research Based on Deep Learning"<br/>Yongpei Zhu, Hongwei Fan, Kehong Yuan1
